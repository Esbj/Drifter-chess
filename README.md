#Drifter chess

This project is a JS based implementation of the game tic-tac-toe.

I intend to uppdate this project along as I learn new things in the courses for the program Frontend 22 at Bor√•s YH. The aim of the project is to rehearse, practise and have something to apply my knowledge to. 

## Changelog:
v.1.0 Basic working tic tac toe using HTML prompt and alert for the game input.

### Future features

1. Recognize when a game has ended.
2. Swap from alert/prompt based input to a printed HTML file with hitboxes.
